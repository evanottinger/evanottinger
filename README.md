### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Evan Ottinger--a full-stack web developer and an information security enthusiast. My repository is full of projects I've started but haven't quite finished (I'll get to them eventually).

You probably don't know me, but if you do it's either from my (minor) contribution to TCM's `Breach Parse` or from implementing dark mode on the TCM-Academy.
